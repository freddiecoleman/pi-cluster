## Pi Cluster

I have built an Elasticsearch cluster of Raspberry Pis that contains the complete works of Shakespeare.

This Java application uses the Elasticsearch Java API to allow the user to search for words. The search results display the exact sentence that the word appears in as well as the name of the speaker of the word, the speech number, and the name of the play. It also generates a bar chart showing the plays that the word appears in most.
